# Swagger UI

[![GoDevDoc](https://img.shields.io/badge/dev-doc-00ADD8?logo=go)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/swaggest/swgui)

Package `swgui` (Swagger UI) provides HTTP handler to serve Swagger UI. All assets are embedded in Go source code, so
just build and run.

### V3

Static assets for `v3` are built from Swagger
UI [v3.52.5](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/releases/tag/v3.52.5).

[CDN-based](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/swagger-ui) `v3cdn` uses Swagger
UI [v3.52.4](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/releases/tag/v3.52.4).

### V4

Static assets for `v4` are built from Swagger
UI [v4.18.1](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/releases/tag/v4.18.1).

[CDN-based](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/swagger-ui) `v4cdn` uses Swagger
UI [v4.18.1](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/releases/tag/v4.18.1).


## How to use

```go
package main

import (
	"net/http"

	"github.com/swaggest/swgui/v3emb" // For go1.16 or later.
	// "github.com/swaggest/swgui/v3" // For go1.15 and below.
)

func main() {
	http.Handle("/", v3.NewHandler("My API", "/swagger.json", "/"))
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

If you use `go1.16` or later, you can import natively embedded assets with `"github.com/swaggest/swgui/v3emb"`, it may
help to lower application memory usage.

## Use CDN for assets

In order to reduce binary size you can import `github.com/swaggest/swgui/v3cdn` to use CDN hosted assets.

Also you can use `swguicdn` build tag to enable CDN mode for `github.com/swaggest/swgui/v3` import.

Be aware that CDN mode may be considered inappropriate for security or networking reasons.

## Run as standalone server

Install `swgui-server`

    go get github.com/swaggest/swgui/...

Start server

    swgui-server -port 8080
